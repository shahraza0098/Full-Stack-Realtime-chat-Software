React App Project
This project is a React-based application developed using Create React App. It showcases key features of React such as component-based development, state management, and responsive UI.

Features

Production Build: Build the app for production, creating an optimized and minified version ready for deployment.
Interactive Testing: Run tests interactively to ensure application functionality.
Available Commands
npm start
Starts the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

npm test
Launches the test runner in watch mode. Use this command to validate the functionality of various components.

npm run build
Builds the application for production. The optimized output is saved in the build folder and is ready for deployment.
